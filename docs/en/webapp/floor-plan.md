# Floor Plan

## Place channels on the floor plan

1. Select the **"Place channel" (C)** tool
2. Click on the desired position on the floor plan
3. The channel marker appears as a numbered circle marker (red with arrow)

## Using a background image

A background image (e.g. a scan of the stage plan) can be added in two ways:

- **Via the template floor plan:** Stored in the venue template and automatically inherited by all shows
- **Manually:** Click the **↑ Upload** icon in the toolbar → select an image file

Allowed formats: **PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP**. A PDF stage plan is not supported and must be converted first — an incorrect format shows "Invalid file type. Allowed: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP".

::: warning Only one background image per template
A new background image replaces the old one immediately, without confirmation. Unlike photos in the Photos tab, the background image is **not compressed or resized** — a large scan stays at full size and is reloaded every time the floor plan is opened. For faster loading, it's worth resizing the image yourself beforehand.

To remove: click the **⊠** icon.

## Export as PNG

Click the **↓** icon in the toolbar → the current floor plan is downloaded as a PNG file.

::: info Note
For export as PDF (incl. channel list) use **Export → PDF** in the top menu bar.
