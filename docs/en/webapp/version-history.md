# Version History

LuxStage automatically saves a **version history** of all changes to channels and sections of a show. This allows earlier states to be restored. The history contains a maximum of 50 versions; older ones are automatically removed.

## When are versions saved?

- Automatically every 10 minutes — but only if channels or sections have actually changed since the last snapshot. During quiet periods with no changes, no new entries are created.
- Additionally when opening a show, independent of the 10-minute interval.
- **Archived shows** no longer receive automatic snapshots. It's worth checking the current state before archiving.

## Open version history

Click the **"History"** button in the top menu bar of a show. A side panel opens on the right.

## View versions

The panel shows a list of all saved versions with **date and time**, e.g.:

- 30.4.2026, 17:37:15
- 30.4.2026, 15:01:47
- 30.4.2026, 14:48:31
- 30.4.2026, 14:45:23

## Restore a version

1. Click on a version entry → the detail view shows the date, channel count, and the full channel list at that point in time (channel, fixture, notes)
2. Click **"Restore"** at the bottom of the panel → a confirmation dialog opens
3. Confirm with **"Yes, restore"** to reset channels and sections to that state — photos, drawing, battens and other data remain unchanged
4. Use **"← Back"** at the top to return to the version list without restoring

::: warning Note
Restoring an old version overwrites the current state **of channels and sections only**. The current state is automatically saved as a backup version before being overwritten.
