# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the difference between the iOS app and the web app?

The iOS app is natively developed in SwiftUI and runs directly on iPhone and iPad – no browser required. It is especially optimised for use on stage. The web app runs in the browser on any device, is best suited for text-heavy documentation work, and offers additional management functions such as user management, CSV import, and PDF export.

## Which devices are supported?

The web app runs on Mac, Windows, iPad and iPhone in the browser. The native iOS app supports iPhone and iPad from iOS 26.

## How is LuxStage operated?

Two options: self-hosted – for example on a Raspberry Pi in the local theatre network or externally on a VPS – or as a hosted service at [luxstage.app](https://luxstage.app), where running the server yourself isn't necessary.

## Does LuxStage work offline?

For reading yes, for editing no.

The iOS app keeps recently loaded shows, channels, sections and photos locally and continues to display them without a server connection. It is built for reading: ticking off channels and adding or deleting photos require a connection, and editing the data itself happens in the web app.

The web app requires an active server connection. If it drops, a banner appears and the show view is locked so no input is lost.

Neither app offers offline editing with later synchronisation.

## Does LuxStage support multiple users?

Yes, any number – without roles or permission differences. All users can work simultaneously. Changes are synchronised in real time to all connected devices – iOS and web.

## How do I install LuxStage?

See the [installation guide](./guide/installation). The server is set up with two commands and runs automatically on Linux (e.g. a Raspberry Pi).

## Is LuxStage free?

LuxStage Server and WebApp are open source. Self-hosted, there are no ongoing costs. Alternatively, LuxStage is available as a hosted service at [luxstage.app](https://luxstage.app) for a monthly fee. The iOS app is optional and available for a monthly fee on the App Store.

## What data does the iOS app collect?

The iOS app collects **no personal data**. Only the server URL, EOS User ID, and language preference are stored — locally on your device. Show data is synchronised only with your own server. No tracking, no analytics, no advertising.
