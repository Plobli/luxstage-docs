# OSC (iOS)

The **OSC** tab is the direct remote control of the EOS lighting console over the network. It is available both within a show and globally (without an open show).

## Venue selection

A dropdown in the top left shows the currently active **venue**. Tapping it opens the list of all venues from the server — the active one is marked with a checkmark. IP addresses are managed in the [WebApp](../webapp/venue-template); the EOS User ID is set in [Settings](./settings).

The connection belongs to the whole app: switching tabs does not disconnect it, it survives short background periods and reconnects automatically after longer ones. The connection status appears as a green dot with "Connected · User 1" once the connection to EOS is established. The EOS user can be set in [Settings](./settings).

::: warning Console requirement
**OSC RX** and **OSC TX** must be enabled on the console (Setup → System → Show Control → OSC). Otherwise EOS accepts the connection and closes it immediately. The app then shows "Console rejects OSC" instead of "Connected".

## Sub-views

The four sub-views are switched via the segment control at the top: **Numpad**, **Playback**, **Fader**, **ML**.

### Numpad

The classic EOS numpad input. The command line entered is displayed above the numpad; recently sent commands appear as a history below.

| **0–9**, **.** | Digit input |
| **Thru** | Select range (e.g. `5 Thru 10`) |
| **+**, **–** | Add / subtract channels |
| **Group** | Address a group |
| **At** | Set intensity value |
| **Full** | Intensity to 100% |
| **Out** | Intensity to 0% |
| **Clear** | Clear input |

### Playback

The Playback view shows the live state of EOS and provides the most important playback buttons.

At the top, the EOS address, user and currently active cue (`LIVE: Cue 1`) are shown, with the most recently triggered cue event below.

| Button | Colour | Function |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Back** | Orange | One cue back |
| **Pause** | Blue | Pause playback |
| **GO** | Green | Start next cue |
| **Go Time Disable** | Teal | GO without cue time (Shift+GO) |
| **Go to Cue Out** | Red | Jump directly to Cue Out |

### Fader

The Fader view provides up to five **fader banks** (Bank 1–5). Each bank shows a list of sub-masters:

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Name** | Sub-master name (e.g. "S 11 Kabuki") |
| **Slider** | Continuous intensity 0–100% |
| **Full** | Set fader immediately to 100% |
| **Fire** | Trigger sub-master |

---

### ML (Moving Light)

The ML view controls the parameters of the moving light currently selected on EOS.

At the top, the **Active Chan** is shown (e.g. "705 [0] GLP Impression_X4S_High_Res @ 1613") along with the current live cue.

For each parameter wheel, a card with four control buttons appears:

| Button | Step size |
|--------|-----------|
| **– Fine** | Small negative step |
| **+ Fine** | Small positive step |
| **–** | Large negative step |
| **+** | Large positive step |

Typical wheels: **Intens**, **Pan**, **Tilt**, **X Focus**, **Z Focus** — depending on the fixture profile.
